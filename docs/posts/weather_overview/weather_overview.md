# What is the weather and can it be predicted?

This is an overview post that defines the weather from the physical point of view, gives a theoretical framework for weather modelling and explains why we can't build long-term weather forecasts. It also introduces classical and ML approaches for prediction and shows how they can be blended together.

This post can be a good introduction for anyone curious about how their weather forecast is made. The reader is expected to have a knowledge of university-level calculus and general physics.

The post is designed as slides. Additional resources and code demonstrations are available on the slides via links.
